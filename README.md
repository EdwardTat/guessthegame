# Code Particulars

This app is coded primarily using Py4web, Vue, HTML, Bulma, and some custom CSS's
for aestehtic appeal. 

My difficulties were primarily trying to extract specific types of information 
from my database, doing so as efficiently as I could think of during my time 
crunch, and the best ways to implement that using Vue and HTML

In the future if I had to work on this project again, I would remake the primary 
pages. They were not done for me, those were provided. I find that although the 
menues are functional, they are aesthetically not very pleasant and could be
a source of improvement along with a variety of different ways to view quizes
such as "most recent". I wanted to implement a different type of stat sheet, 
perhaps have the popups function differently as well so multiple stat pages
can be loaded simultanesouly. Perhaps even make a way to share "statS".

Overall happy with the product given my limitations while creating it
